Welcome to my website! I am a powerlifter, musician, and software developer
living in Portland, Oregon. I grew up in Kansas City and spent most of my life
in Kansas. I love making coffee and tea, making video games, and cycling as well.

My resume can be found [here]({{< ref "experience/index.md" >}})!

Thanks for visiting!
