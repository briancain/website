This week in [Computer Science](http://www.cis.ksu.edu/) at [KSU](http://www.k-state.edu/), the Cyber Defense Club put on by [Argus Lab](http://www.arguslab.org/) will be introduced to Puppet as part of a semester long series of advanced topics relating to the sysadmin, server/system management, and security world. I will be giving an hour or so lecture on what Puppet is and how to get started using it. Some basic topics include how to get Puppet up and running on Ubuntu Server, useful Puppet commands, the Puppet DSL, defining nodes with specific packages, and using modules from the Forge.
