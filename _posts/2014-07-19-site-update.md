Welcome to my new website! Seems like that time of year where I decide to scrap my previous website and do something different.

This time I decided to go with Jekyll. Jekyll has proven to be a great technology for simple blog websites that are mostly static. Jekyll also has a lot of great community themes to choose from, so it seemed like the right choice for the job! Other than some older articles, I have a simple _about me_ section that has some information for people browsing my personal website. Otherwise, the main portion of the website will be articles.
