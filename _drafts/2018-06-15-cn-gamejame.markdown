> Little did we know that the loud sound of the train would server as our constant reminder of time running out like a clock on the wall. As each hour passed, a train passed by wailing its horn as if to keep us all awake and jamming.

First off, what is a game jam? Game jams are a lot like a hackathon, where game developers of all skillsets come together for a 24 to 78 hour period and create a video game (or other games like board and card games) from scratch. Often times these jams have a theme that goes along with it. The main thing is these teams go from a simple idea or theme and build out something in a short period of time.

Prior to 2016, I had never done anything like this before but there were a couple opportunities in Portland for me to participate. The first one being Global Game Jam 2016, and the second one being the Cartoon Network Game Jam. Also prior to 2016 I had literally never done anything in Unity, so I guess it was time to start preparing for these game jams and see what I could do.

## The Jam

The Cartoon Network Game Jam had a lot of exciting moments, but I think my favorite was watching Ian Jones-Quartey give us an episode pitch for the show.

Theme: Co-Bruh from the OK K.O. universe. Each team was given a character from the tv show to make a game around

I felt like we were the right amount of ambitious for this game jam. We had a pretty complex idea and we barely implemented it all within the amount of time. Unlike at global game jam where we had most of the game mechanics implemented at the end of Saturday. We got the mini game and line of sight for the AI working about 5 minutes before being interviewed by the judges.

Initially we had some technical difficulties getting stuff to work. My personal laptop didn’t have anything setup for developing on android, so I attempted to use Unity Remote and never seemed to get it working. The software I used to create our map, Tiled, also crashed about halfway through making the map and of course I didn’t save.

A much more exhausting process than Global Game Jam, but I had a lot more fun! I’m pretty proud with the game we ended up with. It was big, ambitious, and goofy as hell.

Judges feedback, and the cleanup process (IN PROGRESS)
How’d I do? Conclusion
Talk about if I thought preparation was well worth it, and if CN Game Jam went as well as it could. What could I have done differently to make it smoother? Or maybe I did everything right?

Overall I believe the preparation that I did initially was a huge help in learning Unity and being prepared to participate in a game jam. A lot of the initial Unity practice really helped me feel comfortable to start.

I think the biggest thing I could of done before the jams was understand how to make builds of a game and also understand what platforms your game is going to be made on. Since I didn’t really prepare to develop a game with the phone with Unity Remote, a lot of that setup could of been done before the jam and I probably could have actually got it working.
